The Pig Game: compete against a friend to see who can reach a score of 100 first!

This Shiny application is was created using HTML and CSS for front end design, and JavaScript for managing user interaction. R/Shiny was used simply as a platform for launching the app to a live server. Play the live version here:

Rules:

Players alternate on turns. Each time a player rolls the die, they receive the value on the die as their number of points for that turn. They can roll the die as many times as they'd like on their turn, but if they roll a 1, their turn ends and their total number of points for that turn is set to 0. If they choose to "hold" before rolling a 1, they can keep their points and add them to their score. Don't be a pig, take what you can, and hold!

First to 100 wins.
